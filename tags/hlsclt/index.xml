      <description>Introduction
Over the last couple of weeks I have written about using Vivado HLS on the command line and an open source tool which can help you do just that. In this post I will give you a look at my current development process and present a quick demonstration of how I approach a new project. I&amp;rsquo;ll cover the tools I&amp;rsquo;m using, my methodology and show you how to pick up and integrate these ideas.</description>

      <description>Introduction
In my last blog I considered the trade offs of moving to a command line driven approach to development when using Xilinx&amp;rsquo;s High Level Synthesis tool, Vivado HLS. As a quick summary I suggested that moving to the command line increases how the underlying tool performs and allows for easier integration with source control tools. However, I conceded that we do lose access to useful features such as &amp;lsquo;go to definition&amp;rsquo; and the optimisation views and that the Vivado HLS built-in Tcl interface isn&amp;rsquo;t overly user-friendly.</description>
